  Lab 2, part3: a full application

  We're going to use the skills we've just been practicing to write a full application
  which is responsive to user input.
  At your disposal are a set of variables which we use to track user input (see
  part3-main.js and part3-setup.js for more details on how this is done — we'll
  cover this topic at a later date). Their values will be logged to console to
  aid in debugging.

  In this lab, which is very much open-ended, your task is to use the value of
  these variables to define the functions below. Try to come up with interesting
  uses of the provided user input.

  Some ideas:
    There are two numeric fields: can you write this application to filter
    using both minimum and maximum?
    There is a boolean (true/false) field: can you write your code to filter according
    to this boolean? (Try to think about how you could chop up this data to make this meaningful.)
    There is a string field: can you write your code to filter/search based on user
    input?

  Remember, this is open-ended. Open ended doesn't mean pointless: we're looking for
  filters that might actually be useful. Try to see what you can produce.

/* =====================
  Define a resetMap function to remove markers from the map and clear the array of markers
===================== */
var resetMap = function() {
  _.each(myMarkers, function(x) {
    map.removeLayer(x); });
  myMarkers = null; };

/* =====================
  Define a getAndParseData function to grab our dataset through a jQuery.ajax call ($.ajax). It
  will be called as soon as the application starts. Be sure to parse your data once you've pulled
  it down!
===================== */
var data = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CPLN692-MUSA611/datasets/master/json/philadelphia-solar-installations.json";

var getAndParseData = function() {
   call = $.ajax(data).done(
     function(par){
        parsed = JSON.parse(par);
        console.log("Parsed the data!");
  });
};

/* =====================
  Call our plotData function. It should plot all the markers that meet our criteria (whatever that
  criteria happens to be — that's entirely up to you)
===================== */
var plotData = function (json) {
  _.each(parsed, function (obj) {
    //var markers;
    if(obj.YEARBUILT >=numericField1 && obj.YEARBUILT <=numericField2) {
      x = L.marker([obj.LAT, obj.LONG_])
           .bindPopup(obj.NAME +'<br>'+obj.ZIPCODE)
           .addTo(map);
    }
    if(booleanField && obj.KW>20){
      x = L.marker([obj.LAT, obj.LONG_])
           .bindPopup(obj.NAME +'<br>'+obj.ZIPCODE)
           .addTo(map);
    }
    myMarkers.push(x);
  });
};
